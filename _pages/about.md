Yuanqi Du is a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at George Mason University. He has broad interests in machine learning and data mining. He worked on Outlier Detection, American Sign Language Recognition (Mili-meter Wave Signals & Kinect), Protein Structure Classification, Molecule Generation via Graph Neural Network and Medical Image Synthesis. He is currently working on GNN for Molecule Generation with [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://mason.gmu.edu/~lzhao9/), [Dr. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/) and ASL Recognition with [Dr. Parth Pathak](http://www.phpathak.com/). He joins [MIRACLE Lab](http://miracle.ict.ac.cn/) in Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, working with [Dr. Hu Han](https://sites.google.com/site/huhanhomepage/) and [Dr. Kevin Zhou](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~skevinzhou?language=en) for a research intern starting Aug, 2020 on medical image synthesis. 

**Drop me an email if you'd like to talk about/collaborate on any of the following research topics or other research areas with me. I currently live in Beijing, China, feel free to grab a coffee with me, too!**
