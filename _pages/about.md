I am a professor in the Key Laboratory of AI Safety in [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn/). Before I joined CAS, I was the manager of [Computing and Learning Theory Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/computing-and-learning-theory-group/) in Microsoft Research Asia and the co-chair of [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/microsoft-research-asia-establishes-theory-center-to-strengthen-theoretical-foundation-of-ai/). I obtained my B.S. degree in Statistics from Shandong University in 2006 and my Ph.D. degree in Probability and Mathematical Statistics from Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011 supervised by Prof. [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). In 2021, I was [named by Forbes as one of the 50 Top Women in Tech in China](https://www.forbeschina.com/business/%E5%95%86%E4%B8%9A/55906). In 2023, I was [named by MIT Tech Review and DeepTech as one of the Intelligent Computing Innovators China](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/13257). 

My research area is machine learning, mainly focusing on its basic methods and theory. My current research interest is trustworthy machine learning, to make the training, the architecture, and the decision-making of machine learning (especially deep learning) be interpretable and controllable by human. Specifically, we are investigating the training dynamics of deep learning, the trustworthy-modual-embedded architectures, and the distributional/adversarial robust learning. Previously, I did research in distributed machine learning and statistical ranking theory.
