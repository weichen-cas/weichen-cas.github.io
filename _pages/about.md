I am a professor in [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), leading the Trustworthy Machine Learning research group. I am also adjunct professor in the University of Science and Technology of China, Beijing Jiaotong University, and Nankai University. Before I joined CAS, I was the manager of [Computing and Learning Theory Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/computing-and-learning-theory-group/) in Microsoft Research Asia and the co-chair of [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/microsoft-research-asia-establishes-theory-center-to-strengthen-theoretical-foundation-of-ai/). I obtained my B.S. degree in Statistics from Shandong University in 2006 and my Ph.D. degree in Probability and Mathematical Statistics from Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011 supervised by Prof. [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). In 2021, I was named by Forbes as one of the 50 Top Women in Tech in China. 

My research area is machine learning, especially its basic methods and theory. About ten years ago, I started to investigate how to train large models fast with distributed optimization algorithms, how to improve the performance of deep learning by understanding its optimization and generalization, and how to make machine learning trustworthy with the lens of "causality". My current research interests are causal machine learning and deep learning theory, such as causality-inspried models and o.o.d. prediction, the implicit regularization of the optimization algorithms in deep learning, robust learning and its applications in IR and NLP, etc.
