Yuanqi Du is a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at George Mason University. He has broad interests in machine learning and data mining. He worked on Outlier Detection, American Sign Language Recognition (Mili-meter Wave Signals & Kinect), Protein Structure Classification, Molecule Generation via Graph Neural Network and Medical Image Synthesis. He is currently working on GNN for Molecule Generation with [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://mason.gmu.edu/~lzhao9/), [Dr. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/) and ASL Recognition with [Dr. Parth Pathak](http://www.phpathak.com/). He joins [MIRACLE Lab](http://miracle.ict.ac.cn/), working with [Dr. Hu Han](https://sites.google.com/site/huhanhomepage/) and [Dr. Kevin Zhou](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~skevinzhou?language=en) for a research intern starting Aug, 2020 on medical image synthesis.
