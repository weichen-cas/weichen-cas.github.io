Yuanqi Du is a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at George Mason University. He has broad interests in machine learning and data mining. He works on Outlier Detection, American Sign Language Recognition (Milimeter Wave Signals & Kinect), Medical Image Analysis, Protein Structure Prediction, Molecule Generation, Deep Generative Model and Deep Graph Learning. He worked with [Dr. Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/), [Dr. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/), [Dr. Parth Pathak](http://www.phpathak.com/), [Dr. Carlotta Domeniconi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aKkIMogAAAAJ&hl=en) while he was at GMU. He worked with [Dr. Hu Han](https://sites.google.com/site/huhanhomepage/) and [Dr. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on Medical Image Analysis in the MIRACLE Lab. He worked with Dr. Jianwei Zhu on Protein Structure Prediction in Microsoft Research Asia Machine Learning and Computational Biology group. Besides Machine Learning, he is very fasinated by Sciences and very intrerested in developing ML tools for scentific problems. He is actively collaborateing with researchers in chemistry, biology, physics, machine learning and data mining.
