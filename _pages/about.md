Yuanqi Du is a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at George Mason University. He has broad interests in machine learning and data mining. He worked on Outlier Detection, American Sign Language Recognition (Mili-meter Wave Signals & Kinect), Protein Structure Prediction, Molecule Generation via Graph Neural Network, Deep Graph Learning and Medical Image Analysis. He worked with [Prof. Liang Zhao](https://mason.gmu.edu/~lzhao9/), [Prof. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/), [Prof. Parth Pathak](http://www.phpathak.com/), [Prof. Carlotta Domeniconi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aKkIMogAAAAJ&hl=en) while he was at GMU. He worked in the MIRACLE Lab in Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, with [Prof. Hu Han](https://sites.google.com/site/huhanhomepage/) and [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~skevinzhou?language=en) for a research intern from Aug to Dec 2020 on medical image analysis. He joined Microsoft Research Asia Machine Learning and Computational Biology group as a research intern in Nov 2020, working on Protein Structure Prediction.
